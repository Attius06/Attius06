- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Attius!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a computer noob looking to enter the Grid in 2021
>"The Grid,
a digital frontier.
I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer.
What do they look like?
Ships? Motorcycles?
Were the circuits like freeways?
I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see.
And then, one day, I got in."
\- Jeff Bridges

- Though currently I feel like Zoolander and Hansel (so hot right now) trying to get files out of a computer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer science, Markdown, python, and GIS
